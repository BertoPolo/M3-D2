<!--     Start from your build week project! It's very important that you start with it even if you didn't code this specific part because reading other developers' code is a skill that is only learnt from practice. It also pushes you to write cleaner and better code in the future.

First of all register on: https://rapidapi.com/ to retrieve your API KEY
 

ðŸŽµStrivify - Improve your Spotify! 
The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from the API instead of having them hardcoded on the page.

Replace the content already on the page (or add new sections) with the data from this api calls:
https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=eminem

https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=metallica

https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=behemoth

Make sure the API gets called during page load.

Add a list albums button. When pressed, displays a list of all the album titles on the page (try to make it appear in a modal)
Add a count unique button. When pressed, shows a log in the console with the number of unique albums in the page. ( you can't use Set, or filter ) -->
    
    <script>
        fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/")
        .then(resp => resp.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data))

        
    </script>
